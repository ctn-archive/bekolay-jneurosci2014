run.py usage
============

  download_data - Downloads data from figshare
  convert - Convert any CSVs in data/ to HDF5
  plot - Run all plotting scripts
  combine - Combine plots into figures
  (dint|ctrl|all) - Analyze all data files, or just dint/ctrl
  paper - Run pdflatex and bibtex to generate paper


Requirements
============

The following are used by code in this repository.
You might be able to get away without some of these.

* `python` 2 (used 2.7, but earlier versions might work)
* `pip`
* LaTeX (`texlive` recommended)
* Inkscape (for converting to PDF)

Python requirements can be install with
  `pip install requirements.txt`

Everything is in PyPI, except for `python-neo`,
which was customized and is available
in [this repository](https://github.com/tbekolay/python-neo).
The customizations made will either be refactored out,
or made into a pull request to the main `python-neo`
repository soon.
