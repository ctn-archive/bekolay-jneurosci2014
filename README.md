Requirements
============

The following are used by code in this repository.
You might be able to get away without some of these.

* `python` 2 (used 2.7, but earlier versions might work)
* `pip`
* LaTeX (`texlive` recommended)
* Inkscape (for converting to PDF)

Python requirements can be install with
  `pip install requirements.txt`

Everything is in PyPI, except for `python-neo`,
which was customized and is available
in [this repository](https://github.com/tbekolay/python-neo).
The customizations made will either be refactored out,
or made into a pull request to the main `python-neo`
repository soon.
